# Mission Bhashini: English to Indian Language & Vice Versa Machine Translation System (E-ILMT)

## Overview
As part of Mission Bhashini, we are developing a comprehensive Machine Translation system for English-to-Indian languages and vice versa. This project focuses on creating high-quality parallel corpora and robust bi-directional Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models to deliver robust and efficient translations.

### Objective of the Project
The goal is to develop and deploy a Machine Translation system as a service for English to Hindi, Marathi, Gujarati, Odia, Kannada, and Malayalam languages and vice versa. The project covers:
- Creation of linguistic resources
- Development of a Machine Translation system as a service

**Target Domains:**
- Governance and Policy (Primary)
- Science and Technology
- Education
- Health
- Agriculture

## Consortia Members
The project is being carried out in collaboration with the following institutions:
- Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC), Pune
- Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC), Noida
- Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay
- IIIT Hyderabad
- AU-KBC, Anna University Chennai
- Banasthali Vidyapith
- C-DAC Bengaluru
- C-DAC Trivandrum
- Dharmsinh Desai University, Gujarat
- IIIT Bhubaneswar, Odisha

## Resources
### Datasets
Parallel corpora generated under the EILMT Project, encompassing English to Hindi, Marathi, Gujarati, Odia, Kannada, and Malayalam languages. These datasets provide a robust foundation for developing and fine-tuning Machine Translation (MT) models.

### Pre-trained Machine Translation Models
Ready-to-use models designed for diverse translation tasks. These models can be utilized directly or fine-tuned for specific applications to achieve improved performance.
